## Cryptography
  Statelessness, verifying the chain without permanant local storage.
  Block validation.
  
## Sharding
  What is an optimal block size? Why?

## Node Dev
  Users validating the blockchain. Making geth/geth-lite more accessible by a laptop user.
  Reducing the reliance on providers like Infura, cloudflare, nodesmith, etc. Leaves a centralized link reliable for the service. 
  
 ## Onboarding, UX
 Can ENS be improved? 
 Identificaion/ Pseudo-anonymity
 
 Ex's:
 MetaMask.io
 haciendas.xyz
 
 ## Testing environments
  Testing environments which validates the protocol's longevity using various simulation tools.
  Stress testing.
