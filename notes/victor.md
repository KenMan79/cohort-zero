## General Interests
My main notes are in this notion doc: [notes](https://www.notion.so/CDAP-0-b59a6b4e92be4aa4837b971afeba06e9)
- Ethereum devp2p networking protocol
- Cryptography
- Layer 2
- Interoperability between blockchains

So I am interested in basically any and all areas of research, just because of
a general high level curiosity, ie, not knowing much about much. However, I am
currently learning about computer networks, so I am leaning towards doing a
project on the devp2p protocol. My plan is to learn about the protocol, look
into projects/research being done now, and also read more generally about other
topics and research being done.

## TODO
1. Read stage 1 and stage 2 of CDAP to familiarize myself with the process
2. Read other people's cohort-notes to get an idea of the scope, other proj.
3. Gather information and current projects on devp2p protocol
4. Gather ino on other research projects I am interested in.
